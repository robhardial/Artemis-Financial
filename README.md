# Artemis-Financial

The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a consulting company supplying individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans are tailored to the specific needs and goals of each customer. Artemis Financial was interested in updating and modernizing their operations, and they are particularly interested in improving their software security. One of the key components of their operations is a RESTful web application programming interface, and they wanted to make sure that it was protected from external threats. After finding out the vulnerabilities of my client's software what I did well was create a mitigation plan for the results of the manual review and static testing. The plan included fixing the vulnerabilities found and adding additional security measures to prevent the application from being exploited in the future. It is important to securely code an application because vulnerabilities in an application can lead to sensitive information being leaked and unauthorized access to important systems. 

 Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by building customer trust by ensuring that their sensitive information is protected. It also reduces the risk of expensive security breaches. The aspect of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging for me was the manual review of the code. It was difficult at first because errors in the code may be hard to identify, and I didnâ€™t want my opinion on the best way to create the code to cause vulnerabilities. To enhance the security of the application, I took several steps. Firstly, I performed a thorough review of the static testing to find any potential vulnerabilities. Secondly, I updated the dependencies found to cause security weaknesses in the application. Additionally, I implemented measures such as error handling, input validation, encryption, and authentication mechanisms to further increase the security of the application. To ensure that the code and software application are both functional and secure, various testing and validation activities can be performed. Code review and automated testing tools can also help find any potential vulnerabilities introduced during the process. A tool I would use in future assignments is the Dependency Check tool. The tool helps to identify potential security vulnerabilities in dependencies and recommends more secure alternatives. This assignment would show future employers my ability to understand the requirements of an application, evaluate security vulnerabilities, and implement effective mitigation solutions.
